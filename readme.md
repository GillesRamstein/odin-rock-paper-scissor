Third Project for TheOdinProjects Foundation Course: Rock Paper Scissor

The goal is to implement the game 'Rock Paper Scissor' using javascript. The code will be run in a browser and the game played using the console (human vs computer).

Edit: Revisiting Rock Paper Scissor to add a simple UI. The goal is to make the game playable using the mouse.
